Lab 6

Cabling 

Twisted pair- consists of two insulated conductors twisted together in shape of a spiral and can come shielded and unshielded.
	Unshielded- Very cheap, easy to install
		  - Can be affected by electromagnetic noise interference

3 types of UTP cables

Straight-through cable- Refers to cables that have pin assignments on each end of the cable
	-Pin 1 Connector A ----> Pin 1 Connector B
	-Commonly used to connect host to client


Crossover Cable - Most commonly used to connect two hosts directly (similar devices)


Roll-over cable- Cables that have opposite pin assignments on each end of the cable (router to computer)
	       -  Pin 1 connector ----> Pin 8 connector B

In this lab it had us virtally connect ports together for all three types of cabling by following the color codes.
