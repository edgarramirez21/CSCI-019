DNS (domain name system) is the way we communicate with devices on the internet without the complex numbers. For example: an IP address 104.26.10.229 is how the computer finds a website that you want to reach
and instead it is translated and presented to us by having a domain name. Ex: 104.26.10.229 = tryhackme.com


Domain Hierarchy
"." = Root

.edu	.com	.gov	.mil = top-level domains

mlt	tryhackme	google 	    USA		NASA	   ARMY = Second-level domains

TLD (top level domain)- the most right hand part of a domain name. (.com) There are two types of TLD, gTLD (generic Top Level) and ccTLD(country code Top Level Domain)

gTLD is how the user is told the domains name's purpose. 

.com - commercial

.org - Organization

.edu - Education

.gov - Government

ccTLD is used for geographical purposes

.co.uk = United Kingdom

.ca = Canada


Second level domain is the domain name of the website itself "tryhackme" (.com). It is limited to 63 characters
and can only use A-Z, 0-9, and hyphens.

Subdomain sits on the left side of the second-level domain by using a period to separate it "admin." (tryhackme.com). It is also
limited to 63 characters and can only use A-Z, 0-9, and hyphens.


DNS Record Types
There are multiple types of DNS.

A Record - For IPv4 addresses "104.26.10.229"

AAAA Record - For IPv6 addresses "2606:4700:20::681a:be5"

CNAME Record- resolves another domain name's subdomain. tryhackme.com --> store.tryhackme.com

MX Record- tells the client which order to try the servers.

TXT Record- free text fields where text-based data can be stored. Can be used to list servers that have the authority to send an email on behalf
of the domain. As well as being able to verify the ownership of the domain where signing up for third party services.


Making a Request

What happens when you make a DNS request

1.) Client checks the local cache for the IP address/ if not, makes a request to your "recursive" DNS server
						|
						|
						|
						V
2.) Server also checks its local cache and if it finds the appropriate address it will send it back to your local client/if not, it will find the correct answer
						|
						|
						|
						V
3.) Root servers act as the backbone, its job is to lead you to the right top-level domain server
						|
						|
						|
						V
4.) The TLD server holds the records on where to find the authoritative server to answer the DNS request. 
	-The authoritatve server is also known as the nameserver for the domain.
						|
						|
						|
						V
5.) Lastly the authoritative server is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name. Depending of the record type the DNS record is sent back to the
recursive DNS server. It will be cached for later requests and then relayed back to the original client.
	-DNS records come with a TTL (Time to Live) value. Represented in seconds that the response should be saved locally.


In the last section it had us manually look up how to find the CNAME, TXT record, MXC numerical record, and the IP address for "website.thm"
