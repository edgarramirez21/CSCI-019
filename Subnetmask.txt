Subnetting: Taking a network and dividing it into sub-networks

7 attributes of Subnetting
Network ID: First IP address in each sub-network
Broadcast IP: Last IP address in each sub-network
First Host IP: IP address after the Network ID
Last Host IP: IP address before the Broadcast IP
Next Network: Network ID of the next Sub-Network
#IP Addresses: Number of IP addresses in a sub-network
CIDR/Subnet: Converting between CIDR/Subnet Mask



How to make a Subnetting Cheat Sheet

A. Start with 1, double until you reach 128  (right to left)
B. Subtract top row from 256
C. From /32, list CIDR notation  (right to left)

128		64		32		16		8		4		2		1    Group Size
128		192		224		240		248		252		254		255  Subnet Mask
/25		/26		/27		/28		/29		/30		/31		/32  CIDR



How to use the cheat Sheet


Step 1. Use given CIDR/Mask to find column on sheet
	A. CIDR/Subnet mask map to each other
	B. Locate Group Size
	C. Start at .0 in relevant octet
	D. Increase by group size until you pass target IP
